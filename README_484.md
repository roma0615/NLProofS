Quick notes:
- Running the main retrieval files (primarily score_retrieval.py, and embed.py) requires the same environment from NLProofS setup. 
- The code requires data from the EntailmentBank repository (placed at the same level as the NLProofS directory)
- The DRAGON embeddings file is too large to store on GitHub, but this can be created via the embed.py file
